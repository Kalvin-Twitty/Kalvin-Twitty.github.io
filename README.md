# My Own Documentation Website

This repository contains the code for my own documentation website, where I can collect notes and details about my own homelab setup.

## Project Description

As a home lab enthusiast, I often find myself collecting notes and details about my lab setup in different places, such as text files, spreadsheets, or even random pieces of paper. This documentation website serves as a central repository where I can store all of this information in one place, making it easier to manage and access.
