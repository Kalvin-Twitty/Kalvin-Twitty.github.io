Hola, 

Welcome to my home lab documentation website! My name is `Kalvin`, and I am a passionate technology enthusiast who loves to experiment with the latest hardware and software.

Here, you will find detailed information about the various projects I am currently working on in my home lab. From building custom servers to setting up complex networking configurations, I love to push the limits of what is possible with technology.

Through this website, I hope to share my knowledge and experiences with fellow technology enthusiasts who are interested in exploring the possibilities of home lab projects. Whether you are a seasoned IT professional or just starting to dip your toes in the world of home lab experimentation, I hope that you will find something useful and inspiring here.

My goal is to create a community of like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology and a desire to learn and grow together. So please, take a look around, ask questions, and share your own experiences and insights. Let's build something great together!

Here are a few pictures of projects I have done/My personal home RIG
