## Hardware at Home

You can use almost anything as a server to get started from deploying Virtal Machines (VMs) to cloud providers, on prim installs or using a raspberry pi to build your project. Things i use currently

* Main Server running TrueNAS Scale
* Dozens of Raspberry PIs running various services like Pihole
* Secondary Server running a version of windows to test various Windows applications

It's worth noting that the specific equipment and tools needed for homelabbing can vary depending on the individual's requirements and preferences. It's important to carefully plan and research the best options for your homelab setup based on your needs and budget. Also, always prioritize safety and security measures to protect your homelab and data. Happy homelabbing
